### What is Delta Lake ?

Delta Lake is an open format storage layer that delivers reliability, security and performance on your data lake â€” for both streaming and batch operations. 

By replacing data silos with a single home for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, Delta Lake is the foundation of a cost-effective, highly scalable lakehouse.

### High-quality, reliable data

With support for ACID transactions and schema enforcement, Delta Lake provides the reliability that traditional data lakes lack. 

This enables you to scale reliable data insights throughout the organization and run analytics and other data projects directly on your data lake.
